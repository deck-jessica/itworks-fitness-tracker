# itworks-fitness-tracker

## Description

This is an application that allows users to create and track their workouts. Once a user navigates to the application, they can view their past workouts on the dashboard, including combined weight they lifted that week and the duration of the workouts they performed by day. They will also be able to create new workouts to add to their database.
